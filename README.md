# Image Compression using Huffman Codes

Huffman coding is a widely-used technique for lossless data compression, particularly in image compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters and longer codes assigned to less frequent characters. This ensures that the most common characters are represented by the shortest codes, resulting in efficient compression.

In the context of image compression, Huffman coding can be used to encode pixel values based on their frequency in the image. By replacing commonly occurring pixel values with shorter codes and infrequent pixel values with longer codes, Huffman coding helps reduce the overall size of the image file without losing any information.

## Huffman Tree
A huffman tree can be generated by first counting the frequency of each value in the input data. In the context of image generation, this will be pixel values. The next step is to construct a priority queue with the values and their corresponding frequency. The huffman tree is then constructed iteratively. Two nodes with the lowest frequency are removed from the priority queue and joined together, creating a new node with the combined frequency. The new node with its two child nodes, is added back into the priority queue. This process keeps repeating until only the root node is left in the priority queue with a formed tree.
